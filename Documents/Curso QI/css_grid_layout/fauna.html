It can generate a teleportation gate, which it uses to warp itself and other life forms of its size or smaller at will. Warpers can be found in some of the deeper biomes (those that go lower than 300 meters), but are especially prevalent around Alien Bases.
                <br>
                <br>
                An inactive Warper, along with many separate Warper parts can be found within the Disease Research Facility in the Lost River, where they were being built, having been stopped mid-construction likely due to the attack on the facility by the Sea Dragon Leviathan. This inactive Warper can be scanned to obtain the Self-Warping Quarantine Enforcer Unit data.</div>
